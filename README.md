# Python package for design of experiments.

Currently implements:
* State uncertainty
* Control input uncertainty
* Delta constraints on control input
* Mean (latent and observed) state constraints
* Design criteria
* Discrimination criteria
* SLSQP optimisation
* Model parameter uncertainty

To do:
* Separate time points for controls, measurements and constraints
* optimisation of initial state
* prepare for optimisation of measurement time points
* gradients (continuous time)
* one-model option (prepare for nMPC and DOP?)
* documentation
* tests
* merge branches
* Static models
* Function in ProblemInstance to specify what constraint(s) is violated

## Pronounciation
We pronounce the package name as '_dopey_'
